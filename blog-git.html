            <p>Git is a version control tool. Simple isn't it? No no .. 
            What is this version control? So every day or I would say every hour
            a programmer writes some code and save it. 
            So what if the code was working a few hours ago and 
            after making some changes it stops working or 
            I don't want the code that I have written recently or 
            I want to backtrack to any last saved code.
            Saving a code to Git is commit and each commit is like
            version of your code. So in simple words git controls the
            versions of the work we have saved to it.
            <br>
            <br>

            <i> Git tracks the changes by different users in different computers 
                and saves it all in a team(or individually) working together.</i> 
        
             <ul>
                <h2>Useful terms in git</h2> 
             </ul>

             <li><strong>Commit</strong>- saving your work</li>
             <li><strong>Repository</strong>-container or it's similar to folder</li>
             <li><strong>Branch</strong>-In a Repository there is a <i>main</i> branch which 
            is analogous to a bucket which stores everything and each member of 
            the tream can create other branches for some purpose which is analogous to mug. 
             Merging of branch to <i>main</i> is analogous to pouring of content of mug
             (individual developer's branch) to bucket<i>main</i>.</li>
        
             <br>

             One Important task in <i>Git</i> is creating a branch and merging it.
             The following steps may help you next time in dealing with the branch.

             <ol>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Create branch</strong>- When you create branch it is good 
                     practice to give name like this-
                     <br>
                     developerName-moduleName
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     After creating branch you can work in the module you have created 
                     branch for and save it in editor. 
                     
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     <strong>Commit</strong>- To commit the work in the branch you can go to
                      GitHub Desktop and click on commit and dont forget to give meaningfull
                      commit messages.
                 </li>
                 <li><strong>publish branch</strong>-Publish the current branch in <i>GitHub
                      Desktop</i> and it's a good idea to view the branch in your git profile.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pull Request</strong>-
                 Now you have to make pull request either from <i>GitHub Desktop</i> or your 
                 git profile.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Merge Branch</strong>-
                After making pull request you can preview the work/code you have done the
                 branch and also share with your friends for review then click on <i>Merge Branch</i>.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pull Origin</strong>-The last step to click on pull origin in <i>GitHub Desktop</i> and <i>Wooaah You did it.</i></li>
             </ol>
        
            </p>
